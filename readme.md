 This repository showcases the simple backbone behind https://buck.social. Buck.Social facilitates $1 bets between friends. It does this by using the xDai blockchain to handle trusted peer to peer transactions. The code featured here is what is used to handle all of the transactions through the metamask browser extension. 
 
If you are reading this as part of the gitcoing grant GR8 hackathon (https://gitcoin.co/issue/xdaichain/site/9/100024347), here is a youtube video showing the work added, which is a notification system. The notification system notifies users of new bets, new comments, and new status changes. The platform is live at https://buck.social.
